            <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="../images/react.PNG" alt="react-icon">
            <p>ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source JavaScript front-end library
              for creating dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically,
              it’s responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology,
              which was then used in some of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as
              Next.js,
              React can be utilized for developing single-page, mobile, or server-side applications.
              It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by separating it into components.
              More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for their
              applications/websites include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.</p>
            <h5>Key Features:</h5>
            <ul class="content-list">
              <li>The application built with ReactJS has a component-based architecture, meaning that it consists of
                several components, each with its own logic written in JS. The reusable nature of these components allows
                you to maintain the code when working on larger-scale projects.</li>
              <li>ReactJS is designed to support unidirectional data flow and one-way data binding. One-way data-binding
                gives you more control across your application.</li>
              <li>The Virtual DOM of React offers flexibility and speeds up app development. Document object models (DOMs)
                are APIs (Application programming interfaces) that manage how documents can be accessed and manipulated.
              </li>
              <li>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax for describing the interface of an application. With JSX, you
                can write and add HTML structures easily in React.</li>
              <li>With declarative UI, React code can be more easily read and fixed. In terms of developing UIs that are
                exciting and engaging, React JS is the best choice not just for web applications but also for mobile
                applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Limitations:</h5>
            <ul class="content-list">
              <li> The high pace of development : The high pace of development has an advantage and disadvantage both. In
                case of disadvantage, since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not
                feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt
                all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and
                learn new ways of doing things.</li>
              <li>Poor Documentation : It is another cons which are common for constantly updating technologies. React
                technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation. To
                overcome this, developers write instructions on their own with the evolving of new releases and tools in
                their current projects.</li>
              <li> View Part : ReactJS Covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose
                some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.</li>
              <li>JSX as a barrier : ReactJS uses JSX. It's a syntax extension that allows HTML with JavaScript mixed
                together. This approach has its own benefits, but some members of the development community consider JSX
                as a barrier, especially for new developers. Developers complain about its complexity in the learning
                curve.</li>
