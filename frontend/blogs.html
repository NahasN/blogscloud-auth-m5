        <h2>What is Front End Development?</h2>
        <p>Front-end development is the section of the web that users interact with.
          This includes everything that users can see, experience, and touch.
          It represents the graphical user interface with various icons such as the navigation menu, videos, and images.
        <p> This type of development is also called the ‘client-side’ since it enhances direct interaction with users.
          Front-end developers enhance the attractiveness of web pages by building sites that are user-friendly and easy
          to use.</p>

        <h2>Top Front End Technologies</h2>
        <p>In the current spectrum of technologies, many frontend technologies in web used in 2022.
          The following front-end technologies are dominated the market in 2022.</p>

        <div class="bootstrap">
          <h2> 1. <a class="tech-name" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></h2>
          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/bootstrap.JPG" alt="Bootstrap-logo">
          <p>Bootstrap is a free, open-source, and powerful front-end framework designed to create mobile-friendly,
            responsive websites and applications. Bootstrap includes CSS and JavaScript templates for typography,
            navigation, buttons, forms, and other important UI elements/components. This powerful toolkit contains
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools to create front-end design elements of responsive websites quickly and
            easily.
            With its pre-built components, users can add themes and icons to their designs.</p>

          <p>The Bootstrap framework was initially developed by Twitter and has become the most popular
            front-end framework available today. Bootstrap is very easy to use since developers only need basic
            HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites
            include LinkedIn, Postman, Spotify, Twitter, Udemy, StackShare, Lyft, etc.</p>

          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Although Bootstrap is designed with responsive 12-column grids, components, and layouts,
              it is also very customizable. With a few tweaks, you can enable a fixed grid or a responsive one.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap also includes responsive utility classes. A responsive utility class can make a specific
              piece of content appear or hide only on specific devices, depending on the screen size.
              Web designers who want to create mobile or tablet-friendly versions of their websites will benefit greatly
              from this feature.</li>
            <li>In addition to LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) files, Bootstrap also includes old CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
              files.</li>
            <li>By providing templates, Bootstrap enables inexperienced users to create a website easily through
              tutorials and demos.</li>
            <li>The Bootstrap framework contains a variety of components, such as navigation bars, progress bars,
              dropdowns, thumbnails, etc.,that can easily be incorporated into your web page.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Lack of flexibility: Because Bootstrap provides pre-designed components, it can be difficult to
              customize the design of your website or application beyond the options provided by the framework.</li>
            <li>Code bloat: Using Bootstrap can result in a lot of unnecessary code being added to your website or
              application, which can make the codebase harder to maintain and can slow down your site.</li>
            <li>Inflexible grid system: The grid system in Bootstrap can be inflexible and difficult to work with,
              especially for more complex layouts.</li>
            <li>Browser inconsistencies: Bootstrap uses normalize.css to fix cross-browser inconsistencies, but this can
              still cause issues with certain elements or styles.</li>
            <li>Lack of support for older browsers: Bootstrap only supports modern browsers, so if you need to support
              older browsers, you may need to add additional code to make your website or application work correctly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. <a class="tech-name" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> </h2>
          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/tailwindcss.JPG" alt="tailwind-icon">
          <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is used for building custom user interfaces. It provides
            a set of low-level utility classes that can be composed together to create custom designs, rather than
            pre-designed components.
            This allows for greater flexibility and customization, and can help to reduce the amount of CSS that needs
            to be written. It is easy to use and can help to improve the development process by making it faster and
            easier to create custom designs.</p>

          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Utility-first design: Tailwind CSS provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be composed
              together to build custom designs, rather than pre-designed components.</li>
            <li>Responsive design: Tailwind CSS includes a responsive grid system and a range of utility classes for
              creating responsive layouts.</li>
            <li>Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust the design of your components
              by changing the values of the utility classes.</li>
            <li>Browser support: Tailwind CSS supports all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11.</li>
            <li>Performance: Tailwind CSS is designed to be fast and efficient, with a small footprint that won't slow
              down your website.</li>
            <li>Easy to use: Tailwind CSS is easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for developers of all skill
              levels.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Lack of pre-designed components: Because Tailwind CSS is utility-first, it does not provide pre-designed
              components like other CSS frameworks. This means that you will need to write your own CSS or use
              third-party plugins to create common interface elements.</li>
            <li>Steep learning curve: Tailwind CSS can have a steep learning curve, especially for developers who are
              new to utility-first CSS frameworks. It can take some time to get used to the syntax and the way that
              utility classes are composed together to create custom designs.</li>
            <li>Potentially large file size: Depending on how you use Tailwind CSS, it can potentially result in a large
              file size for your CSS, which can affect the performance of your website or application. This is because
              Tailwind CSS includes a large number of utility classes that you may not use in your project.</li>

        <div class="foundation">
          <h2>3. <a class="tech-name" href="https://get.foundation/">Foundation</a></h2>
          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/foundation.JPG" alt="foundation-icon">
          <p>Foundation is a responsive front-end framework for web development. It is a popular tool for designing and
            building websites and web applications,
            and it provides a set of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles and layout modules that make it easy to create
            responsive, mobile-first designs.
            With Foundation, you can use pre-designed layout grids, typography styles, and other design elements to
            create consistent, professional-looking websites and applications.
            The framework includes a wide range of styles and components, including buttons, forms, navigation, and
            more, so you can build complex, feature-rich interfaces quickly and easily.</p>

          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Responsive design: Foundation is designed to create responsive, mobile-first websites and applications,
              so you can build interfaces that look great on any device.</li>
            <li>Pre-designed styles and layouts: The framework includes a wide range of pre-designed styles and layout
              modules, so you can create professional-looking interfaces quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Customizability: Foundation is highly customizable, so you can tailor it to your specific needs and
              preferences. You can customize the look and feel of your website or application by modifying the default
              styles or creating your own.</li>
            <li>Community support: Foundation has a large community of users and developers, so you can get help and
              support when you need it. The framework is also well-documented, so you can find detailed instructions and
              examples for using its various features.</li>
            <li>Speed and efficiency: Using Foundation can save you time and effort when building websites and
              applications, as it provides a wide range of pre-designed styles and layout modules that you can use as a
              starting point. This can help you build interfaces more quickly and efficiently.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li> Complexity: Foundation is a comprehensive framework that includes a wide range of styles and layout
              modules. This can make it more complex to learn and use than simpler tools, especially for developers who
              are new to front-end web development.</li>
            <li>Size: Foundation is a large framework, and including it in your project will add a significant amount of
              code to your project. This can increase the size of your project and potentially slow down its
              performance, especially on mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Limited control: Because Foundation provides a pre-designed set of styles and layout modules, it can be
              more difficult to create highly customized interfaces compared to building everything from scratch. This
              can be a limitation for developers who want complete control over the look and feel of their project.</li>
            <li>Dependency: Using Foundation means that your project will be dependent on the framework and its updates.
              If the framework is not maintained or updated, it could affect the functionality and performance of your
              project.</li>
            <li>Compatibility: Foundation is built using newer web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, which may not be
              fully supported by older web browsers. This can be a limitation for projects that need to support a wide
              range of browsers.</li>

        <div class="react">
          <h2>4. <a class="tech-name" href="https://reactjs.org/">React.JS</a></h2>
          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/react.PNG" alt="react-icon">
          <p>ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source JavaScript front-end library
            for creating dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically,
            it’s responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology,
            which was then used in some of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as
            Next.js,
            React can be utilized for developing single-page, mobile, or server-side applications.
            It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by separating it into components.
            More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for their
            applications/websites include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.</p>
          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>The application built with ReactJS has a component-based architecture, meaning that it consists of
              several components, each with its own logic written in JS. The reusable nature of these components allows
              you to maintain the code when working on larger-scale projects.</li>
            <li>ReactJS is designed to support unidirectional data flow and one-way data binding. One-way data-binding
              gives you more control across your application.</li>
            <li>The Virtual DOM of React offers flexibility and speeds up app development. Document object models (DOMs)
              are APIs (Application programming interfaces) that manage how documents can be accessed and manipulated.
            </li>
            <li>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax for describing the interface of an application. With JSX, you
              can write and add HTML structures easily in React.</li>
            <li>With declarative UI, React code can be more easily read and fixed. In terms of developing UIs that are
              exciting and engaging, React JS is the best choice not just for web applications but also for mobile
              applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li> The high pace of development : The high pace of development has an advantage and disadvantage both. In
              case of disadvantage, since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not
              feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt
              all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and
              learn new ways of doing things.</li>
            <li>Poor Documentation : It is another cons which are common for constantly updating technologies. React
              technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation. To
              overcome this, developers write instructions on their own with the evolving of new releases and tools in
              their current projects.</li>
            <li> View Part : ReactJS Covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose
              some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.</li>
            <li>JSX as a barrier : ReactJS uses JSX. It's a syntax extension that allows HTML with JavaScript mixed
              together. This approach has its own benefits, but some members of the development community consider JSX
              as a barrier, especially for new developers. Developers complain about its complexity in the learning
              curve.</li>

        <div class="angular">
          <h2>5. <a class="tech-name" href="https://angular.io/">Angular.JS</a></h2>
          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/angular.JPG" alt="angular-icon">
          <p>AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is an integral part of the MEAN stack
            (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js).
            It is mostly used for developing single-page web applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework,
            developers can create progressive web apps or integrate the framework with technologies such as Ionic,
            Cordova,
            or NativeScripy to design near-native mobile applications.<br><br> The tool has inbuilt templates that make
            it easy for developers to build UI views quickly.
            AngularJS provides simple, fast data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it
            reduces
            the CPU’s workload. It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience.
            Gmail, Forbes, Upwork, Deutsche Bank, etc., are some of the popular websites and applications built using
            Angular.js.</p>
          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>With an Angular application, data binding is performed without the need to write any separate code. By
              adding a few snippets of code, we are able to connect data from the HTML control to the application data.
            </li>
            <li>An Angular application is not browser-specific, so there are no browser-specific constraints. Besides
              internet explorer 8.0, it runs on all major browsers and on mobile devices, including Android and
              iOS-based devices.</li>
            <li>A built-in dependency injection feature in AngularJS makes it easy to develop, test, and understand
              applications.</li>
            <li>A number of built-in services are available with AngularJS, such as $http to make XMLHttpRequests. They
              are singleton objects that are instantiated only once in the app</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Angular’s templates make it possible to create a user interface views rapidly, which aids
              software development teams to become more productive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Less secure : There is no server authorization and authentication in angular. Authorization means
              granting permission for data access and identifying a user by validating credentials. AngularJs can’t
              provide both the features, that’s we call it less secure. </li>
            <li>Only emphasize on JavaScript : AngularJs, totally depend upon JavaScript. If these scripts will hide,
              the resultant pages seem like a basic page.</li>
            <li>Memory leakage : Also, it is a framework of JavaScript and there is an issue of memory leak in
              JavaScript. We can define memory leak as the memory requires by application anymore and due to some
              factors, it will not return to the pool of the free memory. Memory leak leads to various other issues too
              such as slowdowns, crashes, high latency.</li>
            <li>No specific way : It is very vast and complex. In angular, there are many ways to perform the same task
              so it is difficult to predict which is the most optimized way to perform a certain task</li>
            <li>Not supported everywhere : Internet Explorer 8.0 doesn’t support AngularJs.</li>
          </ul>

          <img class="container-fluid tech-img" src="./images/vuejs.PNG" alt="vue-icon">
          <p> The popular Javascript framework ‘Vue.js’ was created by Evan You and used to develop interactive UIs
            (User Interfaces)
            (UIs) and SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best JavaScript frameworks for creating
            a lightweight and adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model) architecture
            pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js extremely easy to implement. <br><br>
            HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the view
            layer.
            Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into big projects for front-end development without
            causing any
            problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel are some of the popular websites and
            applications built using Vue.js.</p>
          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>VueJS provides computed properties, which enable you to detect changes made to UI elements and perform
              calculations accordingly. You do not have to add any additional code to do this.</li>
            <li>VueJS comes with several built-in directives for performing various tasks on the frontend, such as
              v-show, v-if, v-else, v-bind, v-model, and v-on.</li>
            <li>Watchers in Vue.js allow you to watch or monitor a component and perform specified actions when its
              values change. This is a more general way to watch and respond to data changes in a Vue instance. It is
              particularly useful when performing asynchronous operations.</li>
            <li>VueJS components allow you to create custom elements that you can reuse in HTML.</li>
            <li>Various transitions can be applied to HTML elements when they are added/updated/removed from the DOM
              (Document Object Model).</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Lack of Support : Vue.js is a new language which has become popular in a short span of time but is not
              supported by a large community of active programmers. Moreover, the team that has developed Vue.js is also
              small resulting into the limited support. We can say that having a closed community is a disadvantage of
              this framework. Technology is evolving in nature, let’s keep the finger-crossed.</li>
            <li>Language Barriers : Language barrier is another limitation of Vue.js which is being cited by many
              experts. Its creators are Chinese-American and they prefer the Chinese language over any other, which is
              not used in most of the countries. The coding of the framework written in Chinese creates issues for
              non-China developers.</li>
            <li>Over Flexibility : In large projects where many developers are involved, the flexibility of Vue.js
              becomes an issue that can be sorted out if there is a large community present. There might be events when
              the over-flexibility of Vue.js can lead to more errors and make the project over complicated.</li>
            <li> Limited Plugins : Vue.js is new and still in the development phase so the support for many plugins is
              not available. But Vue.js can be combined with React or Angular to overcome this issue. To handle this
              situation developers switch to other languages.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="nextjs">
          <h2>7. <a class="tech-name" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.JS</a></h2>

          <p>Next.js could also be a React framework platform for developing software applications using React library.
            It has tons of features that make the event of React applications easier. As a programmer, we don't get to
            start from scratch when there are already tools designed to help us with our projects. Frameworks are
            software
            developed and employed by developers to create applications, so Next.js is one of them. <br><br>
            Netflix, Uber, Starbucks, and Twitch are just a few of the world's biggest and most well-known firms that
            use Next.js.
            It's also one of the most popular React frameworks, making it ideal for working with static webpages,
            which has recently been a hot topic in the web development community.</p>
          <h5>Key Features:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes): With NextJS, we don't need to care about
              writing a code for routers for the pages. We create a page in a special folder, and NextJS provides it
              with routing, simple as that :)</li>
            <li>Pre-rendering: both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported. Server-side
              rendering (SSR) prepares the content of a page on a server, while a one-page React application uses
              client-side rendering (CSR). The problem with CSR is that it's not SEO-friendly because search engines
              will not see the page's actual content. Using SSR in NextJS can avoid such issues as a flickering page
              while data fetching, and our website content will be SEO friendly.</li>
            <li>Built-in CSS and Sass support: and support for any CSS-in-JS library</li>
            <li>Full-stack capabilities: NextJS makes it easier for React developers to add backend code to the project.
              It is very easy to add our code for storing data, getting data, authentication, etc.</li>
            <li>Static Exports: Using the next export command, Next.js allows you to export a fully static site from
              your app</li>
            <li>Dynamic components: We can also import javascript modules and React components dynamically.</li>
            <li>Prefetching: The Link component, used to link different pages, supports a prefetch prop that
              automatically prefetches page resources (including code missing due to code splitting) in the background.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Limitations:</h5>
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Routing: Because Next.js is limited to using only a file router, we cannot change the way it handles
              routes. To use dynamic routes, you will need a Node.js server.</li>
            <li>Build Time: Because Next.js supports the static building of the entire website, building apps with
              multiple pages can take quite a long time.</li>
